# Introduction

We performed an experiment measuring the **value** in two different groups, A and B. Methods and results are shown below.

# Methods

We collected 10 samples in each group A and B. We analyzed the _value_ of each sample in each _group_. 

# Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.delim("data.txt")

mean_a <- mean(dat$value[dat$group=="A"])

mean_b <- mean(dat$value[dat$group=="B"])
```

The mean of group A is: `r mean_a`. The mean of group B is: `r mean_b`. 

Here are the results of a two-sample t-test:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(value~group, data=dat)
```

Next, let's plot the data:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of means of group A and B."}
barplot(c(mean_a, mean_b), names=c("Mean A", "Mean B"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Box and whisker plot of groups A and B."}
boxplot(value~group, data=dat)
```
